# SemanticsAction

```dart
class SemanticsAction {}
```

The possible actions that can be conveyed from the operating system accessibility APIs to a semantics node.

### index

```dart
int index
```

The numerical value for this action.

Each action has one bit set in this bit field.

### name

```dart
String name
```

A human-readable name for this flag, used for debugging purposes.

### tap

```dart
SemanticsAction tap
```

The equivalent of a user briefly tapping the screen with the finger without moving it.

### longPress

```dart
SemanticsAction longPress
```

The equivalent of a user pressing and holding the screen with the finger for a few seconds without moving it.

### scrollLeft

```dart
SemanticsAction scrollLeft
```

The equivalent of a user moving their finger across the screen from right to left.

This action should be recognized by controls that are horizontally scrollable.

### scrollRight

```dart
SemanticsAction scrollRight
```

The equivalent of a user moving their finger across the screen from left to right.

This action should be recognized by controls that are horizontally scrollable.

### scrollUp

```dart
SemanticsAction scrollUp
```

The equivalent of a user moving their finger across the screen from bottom to top.

This action should be recognized by controls that are vertically scrollable.

### scrollDown

```dart
SemanticsAction scrollDown
```

The equivalent of a user moving their finger across the screen from top to bottom.

This action should be recognized by controls that are vertically scrollable.

### scrollToOffset

```dart
SemanticsAction scrollToOffset
```

A request to scroll the scrollable container to a given scroll offset.

The payload of this [SemanticsAction] is a flutter-standard-encoded [Float64List] of length 2 containing the target horizontal and vertical offsets (in logical pixels) the receiving scrollable container should scroll to.

This action is used by iOS Full Keyboard Access to reveal contents that are currently not visible in the viewport.

### increase

```dart
SemanticsAction increase
```

A request to increase the value represented by the semantics node.

For example, this action might be recognized by a slider control.

### decrease

```dart
SemanticsAction decrease
```

A request to decrease the value represented by the semantics node.

For example, this action might be recognized by a slider control.

### showOnScreen

```dart
SemanticsAction showOnScreen
```

A request to fully show the semantics node on screen.

For example, this action might be send to a node in a scrollable list that is partially off screen to bring it on screen.

### moveCursorForwardByCharacter

```dart
SemanticsAction moveCursorForwardByCharacter
```

Move the cursor forward by one character.

This is for example used by the cursor control in text fields.

The action includes a boolean argument, which indicates whether the cursor movement should extend (or start) a selection.

### moveCursorBackwardByCharacter

```dart
SemanticsAction moveCursorBackwardByCharacter
```

Move the cursor backward by one character.

This is for example used by the cursor control in text fields.

The action includes a boolean argument, which indicates whether the cursor movement should extend (or start) a selection.

### setText

```dart
SemanticsAction setText
```

Replaces the current text in the text field.

This is for example used by the text editing in voice access.

The action includes a string argument, which is the new text to replace.

### setSelection

```dart
SemanticsAction setSelection
```

Set the text selection to the given range.

The provided argument is a Map<String, int> which includes the keys `base` and `extent` indicating where the selection within the `value` of the semantics node should start and where it should end. Values for both keys can range from 0 to length of `value` (inclusive).

Setting `base` and `extent` to the same value will move the cursor to that position (without selecting anything).

### copy

```dart
SemanticsAction copy
```

Copy the current selection to the clipboard.

### cut

```dart
SemanticsAction cut
```

Cut the current selection and place it in the clipboard.

```

Paste the current content of the clipboard.

### didGainAccessibilityFocus

```dart
SemanticsAction didGainAccessibilityFocus
```

Indicates that the node has gained accessibility focus.

This handler is invoked when the node annotated with this handler gains the accessibility focus. The accessibility focus is the green (on Android with TalkBack) or black (on iOS with VoiceOver) rectangle shown on screen to indicate what element an accessibility user is currently interacting with.

The accessibility focus is different from the input focus. The input focus is usually held by the element that currently responds to keyboard inputs. Accessibility focus and input focus can be held by two different nodes!

See also:

- [focus], which controls the input focus.

### didLoseAccessibilityFocus

```dart
SemanticsAction didLoseAccessibilityFocus
```

Indicates that the node has lost accessibility focus.

This handler is invoked when the node annotated with this handler loses the accessibility focus. The accessibility focus is the green (on Android with TalkBack) or black (on iOS with VoiceOver) rectangle shown on screen to indicate what element an accessibility user is currently interacting with.

The accessibility focus is different from the input focus. The input focus is usually held by the element that currently responds to keyboard inputs. Accessibility focus and input focus can be held by two different nodes!

### customAction

```dart
SemanticsAction customAction
```

Indicates that the user has invoked a custom accessibility action.

This handler is added automatically whenever a custom accessibility action is added to a semantics node.

### dismiss

```dart
SemanticsAction dismiss
```

A request that the node should be dismissed.

A [SnackBar], for example, may have a dismiss action to indicate to the user that it can be removed after it is no longer relevant. On Android, (with TalkBack) special hint text is spoken when focusing the node and a custom action is available in the local context menu. On iOS, (with VoiceOver) users can perform a standard gesture to dismiss it.

### moveCursorForwardByWord

```dart
SemanticsAction moveCursorForwardByWord
```

Move the cursor forward by one word.

This is for example used by the cursor control in text fields.

The action includes a boolean argument, which indicates whether the cursor movement should extend (or start) a selection.

### moveCursorBackwardByWord

```dart
SemanticsAction moveCursorBackwardByWord
```

Move the cursor backward by one word.

This is for example used by the cursor control in text fields.

The action includes a boolean argument, which indicates whether the cursor movement should extend (or start) a selection.

### focus

```dart
SemanticsAction focus
```

Move the input focus to the respective widget.

Most commonly, the input focus determines which widget will receive keyboard input. Semantics nodes that can receive this action are expected to have [SemanticsFlag.isFocusable] set. Examples of such focusable widgets include buttons, checkboxes, switches, and text fields.

Upon receiving this action, the corresponding widget must move input focus to itself. Doing otherwise is likely to lead to a poor user experience, such as user input routed to a wrong widget. Text fields in particular, must immediately become editable, opening a virtual keyboard, if needed. Buttons must respond to tap/click events from the keyboard.

Widget reaction to this action must be idempotent. It is possible to receive this action more than once, or when the widget is already focused.

Focus behavior is specific to the platform and to the assistive technology used. Typically on desktop operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, moving accessibility focus will also move the input focus. On mobile it is more common for the accessibility focus to be detached from the input focus. In order to synchronize the two, a user takes an explicit action (e.g. double-tap to activate). Sometimes this behavior is configurable. For example, VoiceOver on macOS can be configured in the global OS user settings to either move the input focus together with the VoiceOver focus, or to keep the two detached. For this reason, widgets should not expect to receive [didGainAccessibilityFocus] and [focus] actions to be reported in any particular combination or order.

On the web, the DOM "focus" event is equivalent to [SemanticsAction.focus]. Accessibility focus is not observable from within the browser. Instead, the browser, based on the platform features and user preferences, makes the determination on whether input focus should be moved to an element and, if so, fires a DOM "focus" event. This event is forwarded to the framework as [SemanticsAction.focus]. For this reason, on the web, the engine never sends [didGainAccessibilityFocus].

On Android input focus is observable as `AccessibilityAction#ACTION_FOCUS` and is separate from accessibility focus, which is observed as `AccessibilityAction#ACTION_ACCESSIBILITY_FOCUS`.

See also:

- [didGainAccessibilityFocus], which informs the framework about accessibility focus ring, such as the TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS), moving which does not move the input focus.

### expand

```dart
SemanticsAction expand
```

A request that the node should be expanded.

For example, this action might be recognized by a dropdown.

### collapse

```dart
SemanticsAction collapse
```

A request that the node should be collapsed.

For example, this action might be recognized by a dropdown.

### values

```dart
List<SemanticsAction> get values
```

### fromIndex()

```dart
SemanticsAction? fromIndex(int index)
```

### toString()

```dart
String toString()
```

class SemanticsFlag {}
```

A Boolean value that can be associated with a semantics node.

### index

```dart
int index
```

The numerical value for this flag.

Each flag has one bit set in this bit field.

### name

```dart
String name
```

A human-readable name for this flag, used for debugging purposes.

### hasCheckedState

```dart
SemanticsFlag hasCheckedState
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.hasCheckedState} The semantics node has the quality of either being "checked" or "unchecked".

This flag is mutually exclusive with [hasToggledState].

For example, a checkbox or a radio button widget has checked state.

See also:

- [SemanticsFlag.isChecked], which controls whether the node is "checked" or "unchecked". {@endtemplate}

### isChecked

```dart
SemanticsFlag isChecked
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isChecked} Whether a semantics node that [hasCheckedState] is checked.

If true, the semantics node is "checked". If false, the semantics node is "unchecked".

For example, if a checkbox has a visible checkmark, [isChecked] is true.

See also:

- [SemanticsFlag.hasCheckedState], which enables a checked state. {@endtemplate}

### isCheckStateMixed

```dart
SemanticsFlag isCheckStateMixed
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isCheckStateMixed} Whether a tristate checkbox is in its mixed state.

If this is true, the check box this semantics node represents is in a mixed state.

For example, a [Checkbox] with [Checkbox.tristate] set to true can have checked, unchecked, or mixed state.

Must be false when the checkbox is either checked or unchecked. {@endtemplate}

### hasSelectedState

```dart
SemanticsFlag hasSelectedState
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.hasSelectedState} The semantics node has the quality of either being "selected" or "unselected".

Whether the widget corresponding to this node is currently selected or not is determined by the [isSelected] flag.

When this flag is not set, the corresponding widget cannot be selected by the user, and the presence or the lack of [isSelected] does not carry any meaning. {@endtemplate}

### isSelected

```dart
SemanticsFlag isSelected
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isSelected} Whether a semantics node is selected.

This flag only has meaning in nodes that have [hasSelectedState] flag set.

If true, the semantics node is "selected". If false, the semantics node is "unselected".

For example, the active tab in a tab bar has [isSelected] set to true. {@endtemplate}

### isButton

```dart
SemanticsFlag isButton
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isButton} Whether the semantic node represents a button.

Platforms have special handling for buttons, for example Android's TalkBack and iOS's VoiceOver provides an additional hint when the focused object is a button. {@endtemplate}

### isTextField

```dart
SemanticsFlag isTextField
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isTextField} Whether the semantic node represents a text field.

Text fields are announced as such and allow text input via accessibility affordances. {@endtemplate}

### isSlider

```dart
SemanticsFlag isSlider
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isSlider} Whether the semantic node represents a slider. {@endtemplate}

### isKeyboardKey

```dart
SemanticsFlag isKeyboardKey
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isKeyboardKey} Whether the semantic node represents a keyboard key. {@endtemplate}

### isReadOnly

```dart
SemanticsFlag isReadOnly
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isReadOnly} Whether the semantic node is read only.

Only applicable when [isTextField] is true. {@endtemplate}

### isLink

```dart
SemanticsFlag isLink
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isLink} Whether the semantic node is an interactive link.

Platforms have special handling for links, for example iOS's VoiceOver provides an additional hint when the focused object is a link, as well as the ability to parse the links through another navigation menu. {@endtemplate}

### isFocusable

```dart
SemanticsFlag isFocusable
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isFocusable} Whether the semantic node is able to hold the user's focus.

The focused element is usually the current receiver of keyboard inputs. {@endtemplate}

### isFocused

```dart
SemanticsFlag isFocused
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isFocused} Whether the semantic node currently holds the user's focus.

The focused element is usually the current receiver of keyboard inputs. {@endtemplate}

### hasEnabledState

```dart
SemanticsFlag hasEnabledState
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.hasEnabledState} The semantics node has the quality of either being "enabled" or "disabled".

For example, a button can be enabled or disabled and therefore has an "enabled" state. Static text is usually neither enabled nor disabled and therefore does not have an "enabled" state. {@endtemplate}

### isEnabled

```dart
SemanticsFlag isEnabled
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isEnabled} Whether a semantic node that [hasEnabledState] is currently enabled.

A disabled element does not respond to user interaction. For example, a button that currently does not respond to user interaction should be marked as disabled. {@endtemplate}

### isInMutuallyExclusiveGroup

```dart
SemanticsFlag isInMutuallyExclusiveGroup
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isInMutuallyExclusiveGroup} Whether a semantic node is in a mutually exclusive group.

For example, a radio button is in a mutually exclusive group because only one radio button in that group can be marked as [isChecked]. {@endtemplate}

### isHeader

```dart
SemanticsFlag isHeader
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isHeader} Whether a semantic node is a header that divides content into sections.

For example, headers can be used to divide a list of alphabetically sorted words into the sections A, B, C, etc. as can be found in many address book applications. {@endtemplate}

### isObscured

```dart
SemanticsFlag isObscured
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isObscured} Whether the value of the semantics node is obscured.

This is usually used for text fields to indicate that its content is a password or contains other sensitive information. {@endtemplate}

### isMultiline

```dart
SemanticsFlag isMultiline
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isMultiline} Whether the value of the semantics node is coming from a multi-line text field.

This is used for text fields to distinguish single-line text fields from multi-line ones. {@endtemplate}

### scopesRoute

```dart
SemanticsFlag scopesRoute
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.scopesRoute} Whether the semantics node is the root of a subtree for which a route name should be announced.

When a node with this flag is removed from the semantics tree, the framework will select the last in depth-first, paint order node with this flag. When a node with this flag is added to the semantics tree, it is selected automatically, unless there were multiple nodes with this flag added. In this case, the last added node in depth-first, paint order will be selected.

From this selected node, the framework will search in depth-first, paint order for the first node with a [namesRoute] flag and a non-null, non-empty label. The [namesRoute] and [scopesRoute] flags may be on the same node. The label of the found node will be announced as an edge transition. If no non-empty, non-null label is found then:

- VoiceOver will make a chime announcement.
- TalkBack will make no announcement

Semantic nodes annotated with this flag are generally not a11y focusable.

This is used in widgets such as Routes, Drawers, and Dialogs to communicate significant changes in the visible screen. {@endtemplate}

### namesRoute

```dart
SemanticsFlag namesRoute
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.namesRoute} Whether the semantics node label is the name of a visually distinct route.

This is used by certain widgets like Drawers and Dialogs, to indicate that the node's semantic label can be used to announce an edge triggered semantics update.

Semantic nodes annotated with this flag will still receive a11y focus.

Updating this label within the same active route subtree will not cause additional announcements. {@endtemplate}

### isHidden

```dart
SemanticsFlag isHidden
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isHidden} Whether the semantics node is considered hidden.

Hidden elements are currently not visible on screen. They may be covered by other elements or positioned outside of the visible area of a viewport.

Hidden elements cannot gain accessibility focus though regular touch. The only way they can be focused is by moving the focus to them via linear navigation.

Platforms are free to completely ignore hidden elements and new platforms are encouraged to do so.

Instead of marking an element as hidden it should usually be excluded from the semantics tree altogether. Hidden elements are only included in the semantics tree to work around platform limitations and they are mainly used to implement accessibility scrolling on iOS.

See also:

- [RenderObject.describeSemanticsClip] {@endtemplate}

### isImage

```dart
SemanticsFlag isImage
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isImage} Whether the semantics node represents an image.

Both TalkBack and VoiceOver will inform the user the semantics node represents an image. {@endtemplate}

### isLiveRegion

```dart
SemanticsFlag isLiveRegion
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isLiveRegion} Whether the semantics node is a live region.

A live region indicates that updates to semantics node are important. Platforms may use this information to make polite announcements to the user to inform them of updates to this node.

An example of a live region is a [SnackBar] widget. On Android and iOS, live region causes a polite announcement to be generated automatically, even if the widget does not have accessibility focus. This announcement may not be spoken if the OS accessibility services are already announcing something else, such as reading the label of a focused widget or providing a system announcement. {@endtemplate}

### hasToggledState

```dart
SemanticsFlag hasToggledState
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.hasToggledState} The semantics node has the quality of either being "on" or "off".

This flag is mutually exclusive with [hasCheckedState].

For example, a switch has toggled state.

See also:

- [SemanticsFlag.isToggled], which controls whether the node is "on" or "off". {@endtemplate}

### isToggled

```dart
SemanticsFlag isToggled
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isToggled} If true, the semantics node is "on". If false, the semantics node is "off".

For example, if a switch is in the on position, [isToggled] is true.

See also:

- [SemanticsFlag.hasToggledState], which enables a toggled state. {@endtemplate}

### hasImplicitScrolling

```dart
SemanticsFlag hasImplicitScrolling
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.hasImplicitScrolling} Whether the platform can scroll the semantics node when the user attempts to move focus to an offscreen child.

For example, a [ListView] widget has implicit scrolling so that users can easily move the accessibility focus to the next set of children. A [PageView] widget does not have implicit scrolling, so that users don't navigate to the next page when reaching the end of the current one. {@endtemplate}

### hasExpandedState

```dart
SemanticsFlag hasExpandedState
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.hasExpandedState} The semantics node has the quality of either being "expanded" or "collapsed".

For example, a [SubmenuButton] widget has expanded state.

See also:

- [SemanticsFlag.isExpanded], which controls whether the node is "expanded" or "collapsed". {@endtemplate}

### isExpanded

```dart
SemanticsFlag isExpanded
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isExpanded} Whether a semantics node is expanded.

If true, the semantics node is "expanded". If false, the semantics node is "collapsed".

For example, if a [SubmenuButton] shows its children, [isExpanded] is true.

See also:

- [SemanticsFlag.hasExpandedState], which enables an expanded/collapsed state. {@endtemplate}

### hasRequiredState

```dart
SemanticsFlag hasRequiredState
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.hasRequiredState} The semantics node has the quality of either being required or not.

See also:

- [SemanticsFlag.isRequired], which controls whether the node is required. {@endtemplate}

### isRequired

```dart
SemanticsFlag isRequired
```

{@template dart.ui.semantics.isRequired} Whether a semantics node is required.

If true, user input is required on the semantics node before a form can be submitted.

For example, a login form requires its email text field to be non-empty.

See also:

- [SemanticsFlag.hasRequiredState], which enables a required state state. {@endtemplate}

### values

```dart
List<SemanticsFlag> get values
```

### fromIndex()

```dart
SemanticsFlag? fromIndex(int index)
```

### toString()

```dart
String toString()
```

# CheckedState

```dart
enum CheckedState {}
```

Checked state of a semantics node.

The semantics node does not have a check state.

The semantics node is checked.

The semantics node is not checked.

The semantics node represents a tristate checkbox in a mixed state.

### CheckedState()

```dart
CheckedState(int value)
```

The Constructor of the flag.

### value

```dart
int value
```

The value of the flag.

### hasConflict()

```dart
bool hasConflict(CheckedState other)
```

If two semantics nodes both have check state, they have conflict and can't be merged.

### merge()

```dart
CheckedState merge(CheckedState other)
```

Semantics nodes will only be merged when they are not in conflict.

# Tristate

```dart
enum Tristate {}
```

Tristate flags for a semantics not

The property is not applicable to this semantics node.

The property is applicable and its state is "true" or "on".

The property is applicable and its state is "false" or "off".

### Tristate()

Tristate(int value)
```

The Constructor of the flag.

### value

```dart
int value
```

The value of the flag.

### hasConflict()

```dart
bool hasConflict(Tristate other)
```

If two semantics nodes both have this property, they have conflict and can't be merged.

### merge()

```dart
Tristate merge(Tristate other)
```

Semantics nodes will only be merged when they are not in conflict.

### toBoolOrNull()

```dart
bool? toBoolOrNull()
```

Convert a Tristate flag to bool or null.

# SemanticsHitTestBehavior

```dart
enum SemanticsHitTestBehavior {}
```

Describes how a semantic node should behave during hit testing.

This enum allows the framework to communicate pointer event handling behavior to the platform's accessibility layer. Different platforms may implement this behavior differently based on their accessibility infrastructure.

See also:

- [SemanticsUpdateBuilder.updateNode], which accepts this enum.

Defer to the platform's default hit test behavior inference.

When set to defer, the platform will infer the appropriate behavior based on the semantic node's properties such as interactive behaviors, route scoping, etc.

On the web, the default inferred behavior is `transparent` for non-interactive semantic nodes, allowing pointer events to pass through.

This is the default value and provides backward compatibility.

The semantic element is opaque to hit testing, consuming any pointer events within its bounds and preventing them from reaching elements behind it in Z-order (siblings and ancestors).

Children of this node can still receive pointer events normally. Only elements that are visually behind this node (lower in the stacking order) will be blocked from receiving events.

This is typically used for modal surfaces like dialogs, bottom sheets, and drawers that should block interaction with content behind them while still allowing interaction with their own content.

Platform implementations:

- On the web, this results in `pointer-events: all` CSS property.

The semantic element is transparent to hit testing.

Transparent nodes do not receive hit test events and allow events to pass through to elements behind them.

Note: This differs from the framework's `HitTestBehavior.translucent`, which receives events while also allowing pass-through. Web's binary `pointer-events` property (all or none) cannot support true translucent behavior.

Platform implementations:

- On the web, this results in `pointer-events: none` CSS property.

# SemanticsFlags

```dart
class SemanticsFlags extends NativeFieldWrapperClass1 {}
```

Represents a collection of boolean flags that convey semantic information about a widget's accessibility state and properties.

For example, These flags can indicate if an element is checkable, currently checked, selectable, or functions as a button.

### isFocused

```dart
Tristate isFocused
```

{@macro dart.ui.semantics.isFocused}

### isAccessibilityFocusBlocked

```dart
bool isAccessibilityFocusBlocked
```

whether this node's accessibility focus is blocked.

If `true`, this node is not accessibility focusable. If `false`, the a11y focusability is determined based on the node's role and other properties, such as whether it is a button.

This is for accessibility focus, which is the focus used by screen readers like TalkBack and VoiceOver. It is different from input focus, which is usually held by the element that currently responds to keyboard inputs.

SemanticsFlags merge(SemanticsFlags other)
```

Combines two sets of flags, such that if a flag it set to true in any of the two sets, the resulting set contains that flag set to true.

### copyWith()

```dart
SemanticsFlags copyWith({CheckedState? isChecked, Tristate? isSelected, Tristate? isEnabled, Tristate? isToggled, Tristate? isExpanded, Tristate? isRequired, Tristate? isFocused, bool? isButton, bool? isTextField, bool? isInMutuallyExclusiveGroup, bool? isHeader, bool? isObscured, bool? scopesRoute, bool? namesRoute, bool? isHidden, bool? isImage, bool? isLiveRegion, bool? hasImplicitScrolling, bool? isMultiline, bool? isReadOnly, bool? isLink, bool? isSlider, bool? isKeyboardKey, bool? isAccessibilityFocusBlocked})

### hasRepeatedFlags()

```dart
bool hasRepeatedFlags(SemanticsFlags other)
```

Checks if any of the boolean semantic flags are set to true in both this instance and the [other] instance.

### hasConflictingFlags()

```dart
bool hasConflictingFlags(SemanticsFlags other)
```

Checks if any flags are conflicted in this instance and the [other] instance.

# SemanticsValidationResult

```dart
enum SemanticsValidationResult {}
```

The validation result of a form field.

The type, shape, and correctness of the value is specific to the kind of form field used. For example, a phone number text field may check that the value is a properly formatted phone number, and/or that the phone number has the right area code. A group of radio buttons may validate that the user selected at least one radio option.

The node has no validation information attached to it.

This is the default value. Most semantics nodes do not contain validation information. Typically, only nodes that are part of an input form - text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns - are validated and attach validation results to their corresponding semantics nodes.

The entered value is valid, and no error should be displayed to the user.

The entered value is invalid, and an error message should be communicated to the user.

# StringAttribute

```dart
abstract base class StringAttribute extends NativeFieldWrapperClass1 {}
```

An abstract interface for string attributes that affects how assistive technologies, e.g. VoiceOver or TalkBack, treat the text.

See also:

- [AttributedString], where the string attributes are used.
- [SpellOutStringAttribute], which causes the assistive technologies to spell out the string character by character when announcing the string.
- [LocaleStringAttribute], which causes the assistive technologies to treat the string in the specific language.

### range

```dart
TextRange range
```

The range of the text to which this attribute applies.

### copy()

```dart
StringAttribute copy({required TextRange range})
```

Creates a new attribute with all properties copied except for range, which is updated to the specified value.

For example, the [LocaleStringAttribute] specifies a [Locale] for its range of characters. Copying it will result in a new [LocaleStringAttribute] that has the same locale but an updated [TextRange].

# SpellOutStringAttribute

```dart
base class SpellOutStringAttribute extends StringAttribute {}
```

A string attribute that causes the assistive technologies, e.g. VoiceOver, to spell out the string character by character.

See also:

- [AttributedString], where the string attributes are used.
- [LocaleStringAttribute], which causes the assistive technologies to treat the string in the specific language.

### SpellOutStringAttribute()

```dart
SpellOutStringAttribute({required TextRange range})
```

Creates a string attribute that denotes the text in [range] must be spell out when the assistive technologies announce the string.

### copy()

```dart
StringAttribute copy({required TextRange range})
```

### toString()

```dart
String toString()
```

# LocaleStringAttribute

```dart
base class LocaleStringAttribute extends StringAttribute {}
```

A string attribute that causes the assistive technologies, e.g. VoiceOver, to treat string as a certain language.

See also:

- [AttributedString], where the string attributes are used.
- [SpellOutStringAttribute], which causes the assistive technologies to spell out the string character by character when announcing the string.

### LocaleStringAttribute()

```dart
LocaleStringAttribute({required TextRange range, required Locale locale})
```

Creates a string attribute that denotes the text in [range] must be treated as the language specified by the [locale] when the assistive technologies announce the string.

### locale

```dart
Locale locale
```

The language of this attribute.

### copy()

```dart
StringAttribute copy({required TextRange range})
```

### toString()

```dart
String toString()
```

# SemanticsUpdateBuilder

```dart
abstract class SemanticsUpdateBuilder {}
```

An object that creates [SemanticsUpdate] objects.

Once created, the [SemanticsUpdate] objects can be passed to [PlatformDispatcher.updateSemantics] to update the semantics conveyed to the user.

### SemanticsUpdateBuilder()

```dart
SemanticsUpdateBuilder()
```

Creates an empty [SemanticsUpdateBuilder] object.

### updateNode()

```dart
void updateNode({required int id, required SemanticsFlags flags, required int actions, required int maxValueLength, required int currentValueLength, required int textSelectionBase, required int textSelectionExtent, required int platformViewId, required int scrollChildren, required int scrollIndex, required int traversalParent, required double scrollPosition, required double scrollExtentMax, required double scrollExtentMin, required Rect rect, required String identifier, required String label, required List<StringAttribute> labelAttributes, required String value, required List<StringAttribute> valueAttributes, required String increasedValue, required List<StringAttribute> increasedValueAttributes, required String decreasedValue, required List<StringAttribute> decreasedValueAttributes, required String hint, required List<StringAttribute> hintAttributes, required String tooltip, required TextDirection? textDirection, required Float64List transform, required Float64List hitTestTransform, required Int32List childrenInTraversalOrder, required Int32List childrenInHitTestOrder, required Int32List additionalActions, int headingLevel = 0, String linkUrl = '', SemanticsRole role = SemanticsRole.none, required List<String>? controlsNodes, SemanticsValidationResult validationResult = SemanticsValidationResult.none, SemanticsHitTestBehavior hitTestBehavior = SemanticsHitTestBehavior.defer, required SemanticsInputType inputType, required Locale? locale, required String minValue, required String maxValue})
```

Update the information associated with the node with the given `id`.

The semantics nodes form a tree, with the root of the tree always having an id of zero. The `childrenInTraversalOrder` and `childrenInHitTestOrder` are the ids of the nodes that are immediate children of this node. The former enumerates children in traversal order, and the latter enumerates the same children in the hit test order. The two lists must have the same length and contain the same ids. They may only differ in the order the ids are listed in. For more information about different child orders, see [DebugSemanticsDumpOrder].

The system retains the nodes that are currently reachable from the root. A given update need not contain information for nodes that do not change in the update. If a node is not reachable from the root after an update, the node will be discarded from the tree.

The `flags` are a bit field of [SemanticsFlag]s that apply to this node.

The `actions` are a bit field of [SemanticsAction]s that can be undertaken by this node. If the user wishes to undertake one of these actions on this node, the [PlatformDispatcher.onSemanticsActionEvent] will be called with a [SemanticsActionEvent] specifying the action to be performed. Because the semantics tree is maintained asynchronously, the [PlatformDispatcher.onSemanticsActionEvent] callback might be called with an action that is no longer possible.

The `identifier` is a string that describes the node for UI automation tools that work by querying the accessibility hierarchy, such as Android UI Automator, iOS XCUITest, or Appium. It's not exposed to users.

The `label` is a string that describes this node. The `value` property describes the current value of the node as a string. The `increasedValue` string will become the `value` string after a [SemanticsAction.increase] action is performed. The `decreasedValue` string will become the `value` string after a [SemanticsAction.decrease] action is performed. The `hint` string describes what result an action performed on this node has. The reading direction of all these strings is given by `textDirection`.

The `labelAttributes`, `valueAttributes`, `hintAttributes`, `increasedValueAttributes`, and `decreasedValueAttributes` are the lists of [StringAttribute] carried by the `label`, `value`, `hint`, `increasedValue`, and `decreasedValue` respectively. Their contents must not be changed during the semantics update.

The `tooltip` is a string that describe additional information when user hover or long press on the backing widget of this semantics node.

The fields `textSelectionBase` and `textSelectionExtent` describe the currently selected text within `value`. A value of -1 indicates no current text selection base or extent.

The field `maxValueLength` is used to indicate that an editable text field has a limit on the number of characters entered. If it is -1 there is no limit on the number of characters entered. The field `currentValueLength` indicates how much of that limit has already been used up. When `maxValueLength` is >= 0, `currentValueLength` must also be

> = 0, otherwise it should be specified to be -1.

The field `platformViewId` references the platform view, whose semantics nodes will be added as children to this node. If a platform view is specified, `childrenInHitTestOrder` and `childrenInTraversalOrder` must be empty. A value of -1 indicates that this node is not associated with a platform view.

For scrollable nodes `scrollPosition` describes the current scroll position in logical pixel. `scrollExtentMax` and `scrollExtentMin` describe the maximum and minimum in-range values that `scrollPosition` can be. Both or either may be infinity to indicate unbound scrolling. The value for `scrollPosition` can (temporarily) be outside this range, for example during an overscroll. `scrollChildren` is the count of the total number of child nodes that contribute semantics and `scrollIndex` is the index of the first visible child node that contributes semantics.

The `traversalParent` specifies the ID of the semantics node that serves as the logical parent of this node for accessibility traversal. This parameter is only used by the web engine to establish parent-child relationships between nodes that are not directly connected in paint order. To ensure correct accessibility traversal, `traversalParent` should be set to the logical traversal parent node ID. This parameter is web-specific because other platforms can complete grafting when generating the semantics tree in traversal order. After grafting, the traversal order and hit-test order will be different, which is acceptable for other platforms. However, the web engine assumes these two orders are exactly the same, so grafting cannot be performed ahead of time on web. Instead, the traversal order is updated in the web engine by setting the `aria-owns` attribute through this parameter. A value of -1 indicates no special traversal parent. This parameter has no effect on other platforms.

The `rect` is the region occupied by this node in its own coordinate system.

The `transform` is a matrix that maps this node's coordinate system into its parent's coordinate system.

The `headingLevel` describes that this node is a heading and the hierarchy level this node represents as a heading. A value of 0 indicates that this node is not a heading. A value of 1 or greater indicates that this node is a heading at the specified level. The valid value range is from 1 to 6, inclusive. This attribute is only used for Web platform, and it will have no effect on other platforms.

The `linkUrl` describes the URI that this node links to. If the node is not a link, this should be an empty string.

The `role` describes the role of this node. Defaults to [SemanticsRole.none] if not set.

The `locale` describes the language of the content in this node. i.e. label, value, and hint.

If `validationResult` is not null, indicates the result of validating a form field. If null, indicates that the node is not being validated, or that the result is unknown. Form fields that validate user input but do not use this argument should use other ways to communicate validation errors to the user, such as embedding validation error text in the label.

The `hitTestBehavior` describes how this node should behave during hit testing. When set to [SemanticsHitTestBehavior.defer] (the default), the platform will infer appropriate behavior based on other semantic properties of the node itself (not inherited from parent). Different platforms may implement this differently.

For example, modal surfaces like dialogs can set this to [SemanticsHitTestBehavior.opaque] to block pointer events from reaching content behind them, while non-interactive decorative elements can set it to [SemanticsHitTestBehavior.transparent] to allow pointer events to pass through.

### updateCustomAction()

```dart
void updateCustomAction({required int id, String? label, String? hint, int overrideId = -1})
```

Update the custom semantics action associated with the given `id`.

The name of the action exposed to the user is the `label`. For overridden standard actions this value is ignored.

The `hint` should describe what happens when an action occurs, not the manner in which a tap is accomplished. For example, use "delete" instead of "double tap to delete".

The text direction of the `hint` and `label` is the same as the global window.

For overridden standard actions, `overrideId` corresponds with a [SemanticsAction.index] value. For custom actions this argument should not be provided.

### build()

```dart
SemanticsUpdate build()
```

Creates a [SemanticsUpdate] object that encapsulates the updates recorded by this object.

The returned object can be passed to [PlatformDispatcher.updateSemantics] to actually update the semantics retained by the system.

This object is unusable after calling build.

# SemanticsUpdate

```dart
abstract class SemanticsUpdate {}
```

An opaque object representing a batch of semantics updates.

To create a SemanticsUpdate object, use a [SemanticsUpdateBuilder].

Semantics updates can be applied to the system's retained semantics tree using the [PlatformDispatcher.updateSemantics] method.

### dispose()

```dart
void dispose()
```

Releases the resources used by this semantics update.

After calling this function, the semantics update is cannot be used further.

This can't be a leaf call because the native function calls Dart API (Dart_SetNativeInstanceField).
