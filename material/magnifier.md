# TextMagnifier

```dart
class TextMagnifier extends StatefulWidget {}
```

A [Magnifier] positioned by rules dictated by the native Android magnifier.

The positioning rules are based on [magnifierInfo], as follows:

- The loupe tracks the gesture's _x_ coordinate, clamping to the beginning and end of the currently editing line.

- The focal point never contains anything out of the bounds of the text field or other widget being magnified (the [MagnifierInfo.fieldBounds]).

- The focal point always remains aligned with the _y_ coordinate of the touch.

- The loupe always remains on the screen.

- When the line targeted by the touch's _y_ coordinate changes, the position is animated over [jumpBetweenLinesAnimationDuration].

This behavior was based on the Android 12 source code, where possible, and on eyeballing a Pixel 6 running Android 12 otherwise.

### TextMagnifier()

```dart
TextMagnifier({dynamic key, required ValueNotifier<MagnifierInfo> magnifierInfo})
```

Creates a [TextMagnifier].

The [magnifierInfo] must be provided, and must be updated with new values as the user's touch changes.

### adaptiveMagnifierConfiguration

```dart
TextMagnifierConfiguration adaptiveMagnifierConfiguration
```

A [TextMagnifierConfiguration] that returns a [CupertinoTextMagnifier] on iOS, [TextMagnifier] on Android, and null on all other platforms, and shows the editing handles only on iOS.

### jumpBetweenLinesAnimationDuration

```dart
Duration jumpBetweenLinesAnimationDuration
```

The duration that the position is animated if [TextMagnifier] just switched between lines.

### magnifierInfo

```dart
ValueNotifier<MagnifierInfo> magnifierInfo
```

The current status of the user's touch.

As the value of the [magnifierInfo] changes, the position of the loupe is adjusted automatically, according to the rules described in the [TextMagnifier] class description.

### createState()

```dart
State<TextMagnifier> createState()
```

# Magnifier

```dart
class Magnifier extends StatelessWidget {}
```

A Material-styled magnifying glass.

{@macro flutter.widgets.magnifier.intro}

This widget focuses on mimicking the _style_ of the magnifier on material. For a widget that is focused on mimicking the _behavior_ of a material magnifier, see [TextMagnifier], which uses [Magnifier].

The styles implemented in this widget were based on the Android 12 source code, where possible, and on eyeballing a Pixel 6 running Android 12 otherwise.

### Magnifier()

```dart
Magnifier({dynamic key, Offset additionalFocalPointOffset = Offset.zero, BorderRadius borderRadius = const BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(_borderRadius)), Color filmColor = const Color.fromARGB(8, 158, 158, 158), List<BoxShadow> shadows = const <BoxShadow>[BoxShadow(blurRadius: 1.5, offset: Offset(0.0, 2.0), spreadRadius: 0.75, color: Color.fromARGB(25, 0, 0, 0))], Clip clipBehavior = Clip.hardEdge, Size size = Magnifier.kDefaultMagnifierSize})
```

Creates a [RawMagnifier] in the Material style.

### kDefaultMagnifierSize

```dart
Size kDefaultMagnifierSize
```

The default size of this [Magnifier].

The size of the magnifier may be modified through the constructor; [kDefaultMagnifierSize] is extracted from the default parameter of [Magnifier]'s constructor so that positioners may depend on it.

### kStandardVerticalFocalPointShift

```dart
double kStandardVerticalFocalPointShift
```

The vertical distance that the magnifier should be above the focal point.

The [kStandardVerticalFocalPointShift] value is a constant so that positioning of this [Magnifier] can be done with a guaranteed size, as opposed to an estimate.

### additionalFocalPointOffset

```dart
Offset additionalFocalPointOffset
```

Any additional offset the focal point requires to "point" to the correct place.

This value is added to [kStandardVerticalFocalPointShift] to obtain the actual offset.

This is useful for instances where the magnifier is not pointing to something directly below it.

### borderRadius

```dart
BorderRadius borderRadius
```

The border radius for this magnifier.

The magnifier's shape is a [RoundedRectangleBorder] with this radius.

### filmColor

```dart
Color filmColor
```

The color to tint the image in this [Magnifier].

On native Android, there is a almost transparent gray tint to the magnifier, in order to better distinguish the contents of the lens from the background.

### shadows

```dart
List<BoxShadow> shadows
```

A list of shadows cast by the [Magnifier].

If the shadows use a [BlurStyle] that paints inside the shape, or if they are offset, then a [clipBehavior] that enables clipping (such as the default [Clip.hardEdge]) is recommended, otherwise the shadow will occlude the magnifier (the shadow is drawn above the magnifier so as to not be included in the magnified image).

By default, the shadows are offset vertically by two logical pixels, so clipping is recommended.

A shadow that uses [BlurStyle.outer] and is not offset does not need clipping; in that case, consider setting [clipBehavior] to [Clip.none].

### clipBehavior

```dart
Clip clipBehavior
```

Whether and how to clip the [shadows] that render inside the loupe.

Defaults to [Clip.hardEdge].

A value of [Clip.none] can be used if the shadow will not paint where the magnified image appears, or if doing so is intentional (e.g. to blur the edges of the magnified image).

See the discussion at [shadows].

### size

```dart
Size size
```

The [Size] of this [Magnifier].

The [shadows] are drawn outside of the [size].

### build()

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context)
```
